### Using Software Carpentry

The lessons are in episodes. 

I will try to keep to time. I may jump some bits. Don't worry; you can get at the materials and you can ask us after the course has finished.


### Zoom and Slack

We use zoom for the main lesson, and breakout rooms for the exercises and help.
